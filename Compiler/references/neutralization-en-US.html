<h1>Syntax Error Diagnosis and Neutralization</h1>
<h2>Iron's Method</h2>
<p>The essence of Iron's method is as follows:</p>
<p>When an error is detected (a symbol is encountered in the input stream during parsing that does not correspond to any
    of the expected symbols), the input string of symbols looks as follows: Tt, where T is the next symbol in the input
    stream (erroneous symbol), t is the remaining string of symbols in the input stream after T. The neutralization
    algorithm consists of the following steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Unfinished parse trees are determined;</li>
    <li>The set L is formed - the set of residual symbols of unfinished parse trees;</li>
    <li>The next symbol is removed from the input string until the string takes the form Tt, such that U => T, where U ∈
        L, i.e., until the next symbol in the string T cannot be derived from any of the residual symbols of unfinished
        parse trees.
    </li>
    <li>It is determined which of the unfinished parse trees caused the appearance of symbol U in set L (in other words,
        which part of which unfinished parse tree is symbol U).
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Iron's Method for Finite-State Grammar</h3>
<p>The developing syntax analyzer is built on the basis of finite-state grammar. The implementation of the Iron's
    algorithm for finite-state grammar has the following feature.</p>
<p>The parse tree using finite-state grammar is represented in Figure 2.</p>

<p>Figure 2 – Structure of the parse tree for finite-state grammar</p>
<p>Thus, when a syntax error occurs during parsing using finite-state grammar, there will always be only one unfinished
    parse tree in the parse tree (see Figure 3).</p>

<p>Figure 3 – Unfinished parse tree when a syntax error occurs (highlighted with dashed lines)</p>
<p>Since the only unfinished parse tree is the one that caused the syntax error during its construction, it is the only
    parse tree to which the remaining input string of symbols can be attached.</p>
<p>It is proposed to reduce the neutralization algorithm to sequentially deleting the next symbol in the input string
    until the next symbol is one of the permissible ones at the moment of parsing.</p>
